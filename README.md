## üîß Features

- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**  
  Uses analog sensors to detect soil moisture levels in real-time.

- **Automated Irrigation System**  
  Relay-controlled water pump activates based on moisture thresholds.

- **Servo-Assisted Sensor Arm**  
  Ensures precise soil contact for accurate moisture readings.

- **I2C LCD Display**  
  Displays live status, sensor data, and system messages.

- **IR Remote Control**  
  Allows manual operation and testing of individual components.

- **LED Status Indicators**  
  Visual feedback for system states and actions.
